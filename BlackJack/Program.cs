    //Doubling down: Is allowed staright after the first two cards are dealt - The player will receive one more card and stay. They cannot ask for any more hits after this third card
    //Split: If you two cards have the same value then you can split them into two separate hands - You will get hit once both hands before staying.
    //Surrender: Is when the dealers upcard is either an Ace or a 10 value - A player who surrenders gives half their bet to the house. The round ends and a new round starts.
    //Insurance: When the dealers upcard is an Ace - A player can 'take insurance' against the chance that the dealer has blackjack.
    //Push: If the dealer and the player come up with the same total - it's a tie
